## Client application

### Prerequisites

* `nodejs 8.4.0`
* `npm 5.5.1`

**Note** You probably shouldn't worry about the versions. I wrote these here because
they are the ones which I'm testing on.

### Installation

```sh
(cd mona-client && npm install)
```

**Note**: Of course you can use these commands separately. That's just a copy-paste-ready one-liner.

### Usage

Start server:

```sh
(cd mona-client && npm start)
```

Then you can open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Sandbox

Use `http://localhost:3000/sandbox/` for testing.
Now it can upload images to the hardcoded route.
